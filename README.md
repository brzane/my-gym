# My-Gym React App
## Overview
my gym is a web based web based fitness and exercise app built with React with Rapid API (youtube search API and ExerciseDB which is a database API containing 1300+ exercises with body part, target muscle equipment necessary, and a form and follow-through animation, this project was built as a part of my react training and because it was interesting to me as a gym addict.<br>
check out the website through this link : https://brzane.github.io/my-gym/ <br><br>
Note: Exercise's images and gif are not loading cuz of mixed-content blocking by the browsers and the api only gives back http gifs and not https and both github pages and netlify forces https upgrades, so feel free to download the code and try it out yourself.

1. Home page:
- hero section
- exercises section by body part
